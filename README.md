## Project Overview

**CAR T-cell therapy** is a form of cancer immunotherapy that engineers a patient’s T cells to recognize and destroy malignant cells. While this approach has achieved remarkable success in treating blood cancers, it faces significant challenges in solid tumors due to the complexity and heterogeneity of their microenvironments.

**CARTopiaX** is an **agent-based model** designed to simulate the behavior of *tumour-derived organoids* which are lab-grown models that mimic real solid tumor environments and their response to CAR T-cell therapy.  
The project aims to bridge the gap between laboratory experiments and computational biology by developing a high-fidelity **in silico digital twin** of tumor-derived organoids for studying solid tumor dynamics and immunotherapy outcomes.

Built on **BioDynaMo**, a high-performance, open-source platform for large-scale biological modeling, CARTopiaX enables researchers to:

- Recreate realistic *in vitro* conditions for tumor growth.  
- Introduce CAR T-cells and evaluate their efficacy in heterogeneous, solid tumor microenvironments.  
- Explore different therapeutic strategies and parameter variations.  
- Assess treatment outcomes such as tumor reduction, elimination, or relapse risk.  

CARTopiaX implements the mathematical framework described in the *Nature* publication *“In silico study of heterogeneous tumour-derived organoid response to CAR T-cell therapy,”* successfully replicating its key results and extending them through improved scalability and performance.

### Project Highlights

- **Performance:** Simulations run more than twice as fast as previous existing model, enabling rapid scenario exploration and hypothesis validation.  
- **Software Quality:** Developed in **C++** following robust software engineering practices, ensuring high-quality, maintainable, and efficient code.  
- **Architecture:** Designed to be scalable, modular, and extensible, fostering collaboration, customization, and continuous evolution within an open-source ecosystem.  

Together, these features make **CARTopiaX** a powerful computational tool for investigating CAR T-cell dynamics in solid tumors by accelerating scientific discovery, guiding experimental design, and reducing the cost and time associated with wet-lab research.

## Project Structure

The diagram below illustrates the **agents and main mechanics** interacting within CARTopiaX:

![Model Diagram](./assets/images/model_outline.png)


The project is organized into the following components:

### Core Simulation Files (`src/`)

- **[`tumor_cell.h`](src/agents/tumor_cell.h) / [`tumor_cell.cc`](src/agents/tumor_cell.cc)**: Defines tumor cells with four states (alive, necrotic swelling, necrotic lysed, apoptotic), four types based on oncoprotein levels, volume dynamics using exponential relaxation, oxygen/immunostimulatory factor exchange, and the [`StateControlGrowProliferate`](src/agents/tumor_cell.h) behavior for cancer growth and state transitions.

- **[`cart_cell.h`](src/agents/cart_cell.h) / [`cart_cell.cc`](src/agents/cart_cell.cc)**: Implements CAR-T cells with alive/apoptotic states, tumor cell attachment/detachment mechanisms, stochastic killing attempts, chemotaxis toward immunostimulatory factors, finite lifespan, and the [`StateControlCart`](src/agents/cart_cell.h) behavior.

- **[`cart_tumor.h`](src/cart_tumor.h) / [`cart_tumor.cc`](src/cart_tumor.cc)**: Contains the main [`Simulate`](src/cart_tumor.cc) function that configures BioDynaMo, creates diffusion grids for oxygen and immunostimulatory factors, initializes the tumor sphere, sets up custom mechanical forces, and schedules treatment/output operations.

- **[`forces_tumor_cart.h`](src/forces/forces_tumor_cart.h) / [`forces_tumor_cart.cc`](src/forces/forces_tumor_cart.cc)**: Implements the [`InteractionVelocity`](src/forces/forces_tumor_cart.h) class with velocity-dependent repulsion and adhesion forces between cells, with differentiated force coefficients for tumor-tumor, CAR-CAR, and tumor-CAR interactions.

- **[`diffusion_thomas_algorithm.h`](src/diffusion/diffusion_thomas_algorithm.h) / [`diffusion_thomas_algorithm.cc`](src/diffusion/diffusion_thomas_algorithm.cc)**: Solves the 3D diffusion equation (∂t u = ∇D∇u - μu) for chemical substances (oxygen and immunostimulatory factors) using the Thomas algorithm and Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method for tridiagonal systems in each spatial direction. Supports Dirichlet boundary conditions and integrates cellular consumption/secretion (∂ρ/∂t = ∇·(D∇ρ) − λ·ρ + Σ[(V_k/V_voxel)·(S_k·(ρ*_k − ρ) − (S_k + U_k)·ρ)]) through [`ComputeConsumptionsSecretions`](src/diffusion/diffusion_thomas_algorithm.cc), which updates concentrations based on cell-specific uptake and secretion rates.

- **[`hyperparams.h`](src/params/hyperparams.h) / [`hyperparams.cc`](src/params/hyperparams.cc)**: Contains the [`SimParam`](src/params/hyperparams.h) class with default biological/simulation parameters and treatment schedule definition. Provides [`LoadParams`](src/params/hyperparams.cc) to read configuration from [`params.json`](params.json) and [`PrintParams`](src/params/hyperparams.cc) to display current parameter values.

- **[`utils_aux.h`](src/utils/utils_aux.h) / [`utils_aux.cc`](src/utils/utils_aux.cc)**: Provides utility functions ([`SamplePositiveGaussian`](src/utils/utils_aux.cc), [`CreateSphereOfTumorCells`](src/utils/utils_aux.cc), [`AnalyzeTumor`](src/utils/utils_aux.cc), [`GenerateRandomDirection`](src/utils/utils_aux.cc)) and operations ([`SpawnCart`](src/utils/utils_aux.cc) for dosage administration, [`OutputSummary`](src/utils/utils_aux.cc) for CSV data export to `/output/final_data.csv`).

- **[`substance_interactor.h`](src/interfaces/substance_interactor.h)**: Defines the [`ISubstanceInteractor`](src/interfaces/substance_interactor.h) virtual interface, which must be implemented by any agent that consumes or secretes diffusing substances (oxygen and immunostimulatory factor). Both [`TumorCell`](src/agents/tumor_cell.h) and [`CarTCell`](src/agents/cart_cell.h) implement this interface via the [`ConsumeSecreteSubstance`](src/interfaces/substance_interactor.h) method, allowing the diffusion grid's [`ComputeConsumptionsSecretions`](src/diffusion/diffusion_thomas_algorithm.cc) to dispatch to the correct cell-type logic.

### Configuration Files

- **[`params.json`](params.json)**: JSON-formatted parameter file for configuring simulation runs without recompilation. In [`params4SphericalModel.json`](params4SphericalModel.json) there is a configuration example for an spherical tumor and in [`params4CylindricalModel.json`](params4CylindricalModel.json) the configuration to simulate a cylindrical one.

- **[`bdm.toml`](bdm.toml)**: BioDynaMo-specific configuration for visualization settings.

- **[`CMakeLists.txt`](CMakeLists.txt)**: CMake build configuration that integrates with BioDynaMo and sets up the C++17 project structure. Modification is typically not required.

### Analysis

- **[`CARTopiaX_Simulation_Analysis.ipynb`](CARTopiaX_Simulation_Analysis.ipynb)**: Jupyter notebook for post-processing simulation results, generating plots, and statistical analysis.

### Auxiliary Scripts (`auxiliar_scripts/`)

Small Python scripts for running and analyzing simulations. Each one has a *User settings* block at the top that can be edited before running it, and all generated plots and results are saved in `auxiliar_scripts/out/`.

- **[`run_several_simulations.py`](auxiliar_scripts/run_several_simulations.py)**: Runs the simulation several times with different seeds (0 to `NUMBER_EXECUTIONS - 1`) using the configuration defined in `BASE_CONFIG`, and copies the `output/` folder of each run to `out/execution_seed_<seed>`. ParaView export can be enabled or disabled, and the original `params.json` and `bdm.toml` are always restored at the end.

- **[`analysis_time_attribute.py`](auxiliar_scripts/analysis_time_attribute.py)**: Plots any attribute of `output/final_data.csv` (e.g. `tumor_radius`, `num_alive_cart`, `average_oncoprotein`) as a function of time, in days, hours or minutes.

- **[`analysis_radius_attribute.py`](auxiliar_scripts/analysis_radius_attribute.py)**: Plots the radial profile of an attribute at a given minute using `output/data_dependent_on_radius_tumor.csv`. Values can optionally be normalized by the area of each ring.

- **[`plot_cell_death_causes.py`](auxiliar_scripts/plot_cell_death_causes.py)**: Plots in a single graph the radial profile of tumor cell deaths for each cause (lack of oxygen, lack of glucose, random natural causes and CAR-T kill) at a given minute, and prints the total number of deaths of each cause.

The radius-dependent scripts require the simulation to be run with `output_information_dependent_on_radius` set to `true`. Scripts can be run from the repository root, e.g.:
```bash
python3 auxiliar_scripts/analysis_time_attribute.py
```

### Model Calibration (`abm_calibration/`)

- **[`optimize.py`](abm_calibration/optimize.py)**: Bayesian optimization workflow to calibrate model parameters against target data. See [Model Calibration](#model-calibration-bayesian-optimization).

- **[`requirements.txt`](abm_calibration/requirements.txt)**: Python dependencies for the calibration workflow.

## Model Replication

All plots in this section compare CARTopiaX with the model results from the *Nature* paper over five runs, demonstrating **successful replication** and reproducing the same **biological findings**. Even though the graphs do not always overlap, this is due to substantial known differences in their modeling approaches and stochastic nature. What is important is that the overall behaviors and key biological dynamics are accurately reproduced, as researchers primarily focus on these trends and peak responses when designing treatments.

### Replication Example: Tumor with no CAR-T treatment
---
The following example reproduces the 30-day evolution of a 150 µm radius tumor simulation with no CAR T-cell treatment applied. The plot below shows the total number of cancer cells and the tumor radius over time:

![No treatment cells and radius](./assets/images/no_doses_num_cells_and_tumor_radius.png)

#### Tumor Heterogeneity:

CARTopiaX models a **heterogeneous tumor**, where cancer cells differ in their *oncoprotein expression levels*, representing varying proliferative capacities.  
Although oncoprotein levels are continuous, cells are grouped into four discrete categories:

| Type | Oncoprotein Level     | Aggressiveness       |
|:----:|:---------------------:|:--------------------:|
| 1    | 1.5 < Oncoprotein ≤ 2 | Most proliferative   |
| 2    | 1 < Oncoprotein ≤ 1.5 | Very proliferative   |
| 3    | 0.5 < Oncoprotein ≤ 1 | Less proliferative   |
| 4    | 0 ≤ Oncoprotein ≤ 0.5 | Least proliferative  |

Tumor evolution visualized in ParaView:

![No treatment ParaView](./assets/images/no_dose_tumor_evolution_paraview.png)

Type 1 cells are highly proliferative, causing their proportion in the tumor to increase, while Type 3–4 cells divide less frequently and, struggling in a oxygen-limited, resource-competitive environment, gradually become less common:

![No treatment Type of Cells](./assets/images/no_doses_type_of_cells_absolute_numbers.png)

As cell quantity rises, **oxygen levels drop** due to increased consumption, while the average **oncoprotein level gradually increases** because more proliferative cells pass their higher oncoprotein levels to their progeny over time.

![No treatment Oxygen and Oncoprotein](./assets/images/no_doses_oncoprotein_and_oxygen.png)


### Replication Example: One CAR T-cell dose of Scale 1:1
---
The following example models the same 150 µm-radius tumor, but with a single CAR T-cell dose, equal in number to the tumor cells administered, on day 0. The CAR T-cell population then declines stochastically due to apoptosis, reaching minimal levels around day 10. The plot below shows the total tumor and CAR T-cell populations over time:

![1Dose Tumor and CAR T-cell amount](./assets/images/dose_scale1_day0_num_cells.png)

All cells consume oxygen, and cancer cells can die from **necrosis** in its absence. In addition, CAR T-cells tend to **eliminate higher oncoprotein-expressing cells more effectively**, leading to the following dynamics:

<u>Before day 10:</u> CAR T-cells are actively killing tumor cells and **Type 1 and 2 cell populations decrease** as more proliferative cancer cells are targeted.

<u>After day 10:</u> When CAR T-cells die from apoptosis, **Type 1 and 2 cells increase** their proportion in the tumor at the expense of Type 3 and 4 cells, as high-oncoprotein expressers divide faster.

![1dose Percentage of Each Cell Type](./assets/images/dose_scale1_day0_type_of_cells_percentage_populations.png)

<u>Before day 10:</u> In the beginning, **oxygen** levels decrease with CAR T-cell arrival. Then they **gradually rise** as both CAR T-cells and tumor cells die, reducing overall consumption. On the other hand, the **average oncoprotein level drops** rapidly due to CAR T-cell preferential elimination of the most aggressive cancer cells.

<u>After day 10:</u> CAR T-cells are no longer present and therefore tumor resumes growth, making **oxygen levels decline**. In addition, **oncoprotein levels rise** as highly proliferative cells dominate once again.

![1dose Oncoprotein and Oxygen Levels](./assets/images/dose_scale1_day0_oncoprotein_and_oxygen.png)

During the simulation, **dead and resistant cells** accumulate around the tumor core, forming a ***shield-like barrier*** that impedes CAR T-cell infiltration and reduces treatment effectiveness.

![Cell Shield Formation](./assets/images/shield.png)

A 3D visualization of the sliced tumor and CAR T-cell treatment used in this example, rendered in *ParaView*, is available here:

### Replication Example: Less is better, increasing cellular dosage does not always increase efficacy

---
We consider again the 150 µm-radius tumor and now **two CAR T-cell doses of scale 1:1** (equal in number to the initial tumor cells) are delivered on days 0 and 8. This way much less tumor cells are present at day 30 in comparison to applying just one dose:

![2Doses of Scale 1:1](./assets/images/dose_scale1_day0_dose_scale1_day8_num_cells.png)

Delivering more CAR T-cells has helped in controlling the tumor, however this is not always the case. The next plot shows the same initial tumor but with two CAR T-cell doses containing a quantity twice the initial tumor cell count, on days 0 and 5. By day 30, the number of **tumor cells is roughly the same** as before, despite using **twice the amount of CAR T-cells**.

![2Doses of Scale 2:1](./assets/images/dose_scale2_day0_dose_scale2_day5_num_cells.png)


Increasing CAR T-cell dosage does not necessarily improve tumor killing and can increase *toxicity*. The model suggests two doses at a 1:1 CAR T-to-cancer cell ratio, balancing effectiveness and safety, minimizing inactive *free* CAR T-cells.

### Performance
---

CARTopiaX successfully replicates the findings described in the *Nature* publication, achieving a **2× speed improvement** compared to the previous implementation.  
This performance gain enables faster scenario exploration and larger-scale simulations.

### Scripts Proving Model Replication
---

This [repository](https://github.com/salva24/CARTopiaX_scripts_proving_model_replication) contains the scripts used to validate and compare simulation results between CARTopiaX and its foundational model, CART-ABM.
It can be employed to verify that the reported improvements are objectively supported by the data.

---
## Dependencies

- [BioDynaMo](https://biodynamo.org/) (tested with version 1.05.132)
- CMake ≥ 3.13
- GCC or Clang with C++17 support
- GoogleTest (for unit testing)

**Note:** Ensure BioDynaMo is installed and sourced before running the simulation.

---

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/compiler-research/CARTopiaX.git
cd CARTopiaX

```

---

## Development Environment (Container)

A prebuilt BioDynaMo — with its bundled ROOT — is published as a
[ci-workflows](https://github.com/compiler-research/ci-workflows) recipe cell,
so you do not have to build it yourself. `bin/start` drops you into a persistent
container with that BioDynaMo in place, your checkout mounted read-write, and
[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed.

This is the fastest way for a new contributor to get a working environment.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**, running.
- **git** and **Python 3** on the host.
- **~3 GB free** in the Docker VM (~250 MB download, ~800 MB unpacked, plus build space).

`nektos/act` is *not* needed. It is only required to run a whole CI job locally
with `bin/repro <row-name>`, which asks `act` to expand the matrix.

> On Apple Silicon the container is x86_64 and runs translated. That is fine for
> developing, but do not trust it for timing measurements or for diagnosing
> toolchain-level failures.

### Getting in

```bash
git clone https://github.com/compiler-research/ci-workflows ~/sources/ci-workflows
cd ~/sources/ci-workflows && ./bin/start
```

Pick CARTopiaX from the list. It clones the project, downloads the BioDynaMo
build CI uses, installs its host dependencies and opens a shell. Already have a
checkout? Run `~/sources/ci-workflows/bin/start` from inside it and the menu is
skipped.

The first entry downloads and unpacks BioDynaMo; later entries take seconds.
`claude` is installed for you — log in once per container. A host that has never
run Claude Code needs nothing extra; if you *do* already run it, anything you
put in `~/.cache/ci-workflows/devshell-cache/ai/skills` is what it sees inside.

### Building, inside the container

```bash
source "$DEVSHELL_INSTALL/bin/thisbdm.sh"

cd /patches
cmake . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++
cmake --build build -j"$(nproc)"
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The compiler pin is a workaround rather than a preference, so do not drop it:
the devshell exports `CC=clang`, while BioDynaMo replaces the compiler with
MPI's wrapper (which wraps gcc) *after* CMake has detected clang. The OpenMP
flags then disagree and g++ rejects `-fopenmp=libomp`.

### Modifying BioDynaMo itself

The recipe ships BioDynaMo's source next to the install, at `$DEVSHELL_SRC` —
a shallow checkout at the tag CI pins, already configured at `$DEVSHELL_BUILD`,
so `make -C $DEVSHELL_BUILD` iterates directly.

To build CARTopiaX against your modified BioDynaMo, install it to a prefix of
your own and source *that* instead of `$DEVSHELL_INSTALL`:

```bash
cmake --install "$DEVSHELL_BUILD" --prefix ~/bdm-dev
source ~/bdm-dev/biodynamo-v1.05/bin/thisbdm.sh
```

The install is self-contained — it carries its own ROOT — and `thisbdm.sh`
derives `BDMSYS` from its own location, so it works from anywhere. Note the
extra `biodynamo-v<version>` level: BioDynaMo installs one directory deeper than
the prefix you give it, whereas `$DEVSHELL_INSTALL` is that inner directory
already, flattened by the recipe. Leaving `$DEVSHELL_INSTALL` untouched keeps
the pristine CI environment one `source` away.

### What persists

| layer | holds | survives |
|---|---|---|
| container `devshell-<cell>` | apt packages, Claude login, your `$HOME` | exiting the shell |
| host cache `~/.cache/ci-workflows/devshell-cache` | BioDynaMo install and source, ccache, Claude skills/settings/memory | removing the container |
| your checkout | **your work** | everything — it is your working copy |

Your work is never inside the container: `/patches` *is* your checkout, so
commit, push and open pull requests from the host as usual. No GitHub
credentials are copied into the container.

---

## Building the Simulation

**Option 1:**
Use BioDynaMo’s build system:
```bash
biodynamo build
```

**Option 2:**
Manual build:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j <number_of_processes>
```

---

## Input Parameters

All hyperparameters are modifiable by giving them a value in the `params.json` without the need to recompile the model after changing them. When a value is not specified the default values are taken. Some hyperparameters are derived from others by default but they can still be set to arbitrary values if wished. Don't worry if you modify a hyperparameter in `params.json` but not its derived values; by default, derived values are computed at the start of the simulation based on the specified ones.

### Parameter Configuration

To modify parameters, edit the [`params.json`](params.json) file. Only include parameters you want to change from their default values. Example:

```json
{
  "seed": 1,
  "output_performance_statistics": true,
  "total_minutes_to_simulate": 43200,
  "initial_spherical_tumor_radius": 150.0,
  "treatment": {
    "0": 3957,
    "8": 3957
  }
}
```

## Running the Simulation

After building, run the simulation using one of the following methods:

**Option 1:**
With BioDynaMo:
```bash
biodynamo run
```

**Option 2:**
Directly from the build directory:
```bash

./build/CARTopiaX
```

---

## Visualizing Results

Data about tumor growth, different types of cell populations and oxygen and oncoprotein levels are output in `./output/final_data.csv` To visualize plots that give an overview of the results of the simulation you can run the provided python notebook `./CARTopiaX_Simulation_Analysis.ipynb`

To visualize the 3D model of the execution in ParaView use:
```bash
paraview ./output/CARTopiaX/CARTopiaX.pvsm

```

## Model Calibration (Bayesian Optimization)

Many parameters of the model cannot be measured directly in the laboratory. [`optimize.py`](abm_calibration/optimize.py) finds the values of selected parameters that make the simulation reproduce some target data (e.g. experimental measurements) as closely as possible.

### How it works

Each simulation is expensive, so trying every combination of parameters (grid search) is not feasible. Instead, the script uses **Bayesian optimization** through [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) and its **Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)** sampler:

1. Each *trial* proposes a value for every parameter to be calibrated within its range.
2. The simulation is run with those values `NUMBER_MONTE_CARLO` times with different random seeds, and the error against the target data is averaged. This reduces the effect of the stochastic nature of the model.
3. TPE builds a probabilistic model from all previous trials, separating the parameter values that gave good results from the ones that gave bad results. The next trial is sampled where good values are more likely, balancing *exploration* of new regions and *exploitation* of promising ones.
4. After `NUMBER_OF_TRIALS` trials, the parameters with the lowest error are reported.

This way good parameters are usually found with far fewer simulations than with a random or grid search.

### Error modes

The error is selected with the `MODE` variable:

| Mode | Target file | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `total` | `target_data/final_data.csv` | Mean squared error of a metric of the whole tumor over time (e.g. `average_oxygen_all_cells`, `tumor_radius`) |
| `radius` | `target_data/data_dependent_on_radius_tumor.csv` | Mean squared error of the radial profile of a metric at a fixed minute. Requires `output_information_dependent_on_radius: true` |
| `custom` | - | User-defined error implemented in `compute_custom_error()` |

Target CSVs must have the same format as the files written by the simulation in `output/`, and are compared on the common values of `total_minutes`.

### Configuration

The sections of the script marked with `Change this` are meant to be adapted to each experiment:

- **Settings:** `EXPERIMENT_ID`, `MODE`, `SEED`, `NUMBER_OF_TRIALS`, `NUMBER_MONTE_CARLO` and `BIODYNAMO_DIR` (path to `thisbdm.sh`).
- **`run_ABM()`:** fixed simulation configuration written to `params.json` for each run, together with the parameters being calibrated.
- **`objective()`:** parameters to be calibrated and their search ranges, e.g. `trial.suggest_float("initial_oxygen_level", 30, 40)`.
- **Error functions:** metric to compare and, for `radius` mode, the minute of the radial profile.

### Running the calibration

Install the dependencies and run the script from the repository root:
```bash
pip install -r abm_calibration/requirements.txt
python3 abm_calibration/optimize.py
```

Results are stored in `abm_calibration/experiment_<EXPERIMENT_ID>/`:
- `abm_optuna.db`: SQLite database with all trials. Running again with the same `EXPERIMENT_ID` resumes the study instead of starting from scratch. Setting `NUMBER_OF_TRIALS = 0` just prints the best result stored.
- `optuna_results.csv`: table with the parameters and error of every trial.

During the calibration ParaView export is disabled, and the original `params.json` and `bdm.toml` are always restored at the end, even if a run fails.
